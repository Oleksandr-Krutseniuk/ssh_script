transfer_file_script.sh

Script aimed at SSH-channel file transmission from 1 host to another.
Script gets a file, archives it and tries to transfer a file to the remote host.
The success of transmission is checked via file presence on a remote host and hash-sum comparison of sent and recieved file.
The results of successful or failed transmission are put in a log-file located on a sender - host.
Additionaly:
To establish SSH connection for the 1 time do the following:
1. generate a key on a sender
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "bastion_key" 
2. perform a command to allow ssh-agent for your private key usage
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
3. If needed, chech the /etc/ssh/sshd_config on receiver host and uncomment (or add) PubkeyAuthentication yes
4. Put generated public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on remote host
